# Elog(Emotion Log) Chatbot

This project is an AI-powered counseling Telegram chatbot based on **Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)** and **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**. All conversations with the user are protected with end-to-end encryption, and users can securely share their counseling records with a professional counselor whenever they choose.

## ‚ú® Key Features

  * **AI-Powered Counseling**: Provides interactive, conversational counseling based on ACT/CBT principles using OpenAI's language models.
  * **Robust Security**:
      * **Conversation Encryption**: All conversations are encrypted using the AES-GCM algorithm before being stored on the server, ensuring that even server administrators cannot view the content. <ÏïîÌò∏Ìôî Îã®Í≥Ñ Ïù¥ÎØ∏ÏßÄÌôî ÌïòÍ∏∞>
      * **Data Integrity**: A Hash Chain is implemented to prevent any tampering or alteration of the conversation logs.
  * **Secure Log Sharing**:
      * Users can export their conversation history from a specified period, along with an AI-generated summary, into a single ZIP file.
      * A secure download link, protected by a **One-Time Password (OTP)**, is sent to the counselor's email, ensuring that only authorized individuals can access the file.
  * **Telegram Integration**: Users can access the chatbot anytime, anywhere through the familiar Telegram messaging app.
