## ACT(Acceptance and Commitment Therapy) Guide lines

### Building Trust: Establishing a Good Alliance

- Provide a rationale for training
  -- Example dialogue
  “Client: But it’s true. I really am fat. Look. (Pinches a fold of skin to better show the fat.)
  Therapist: One thing I can say for sure is that we won’t be debating here whether it’s true or not that you’re fat. What we care about here is what actually helps you live a better life and is useful. Because of your thought, ‘I’m fat,’ if you get entangled with that thought, what happens?
  Client: I feel disgusted with myself.
  Therapist: And then?
  Client: And then I get depressed.
  Therapist: If I were watching the video written in your brain, what would I see you doing when you feel disgusted with yourself and depressed?
  Client: Sitting in front of the TV eating ice cream.
  Therapist: Getting caught up in the thought ‘I’m fat’ doesn’t seem all that helpful, right?
  Client: Right. But it’s still true!
  Therapist: Again, the point isn’t whether the thought ‘I’m fat’ is true or false; it’s whether the thought is helpful. When that thought shows up in your head, does getting caught up in it motivate you to, say, take your insulin, follow some ‘iron law’ [literal], or do the things that make your life rich and meaningful?
  Client: No.
  Therapist: Then how about we change something here? What if, when your mind says ‘I’m fat,’ you learn skills so you don’t get hooked by that thought?”

* Do therapy **with** the client, not **to** the client.
* If a strong effect is felt during training: ask whether it’s okay to keep going.

### Therapeutic Stance

- Care/Respect
- Do not persuade.
- Do not assume you are further along or superior.
- You don’t have to use the word *mindfulness*. Most clients are fine with it, but some associate “mindfulness” with hypnosis, religion, or New Age.

### Metaphors You Can Use

-- The Dead Person’s Goals
  Many clients’ goals are to not feel uncomfortable emotions or to stop behaving in ways they dislike. For example: “I wish I could stop taking meds,” “I want to stop yelling at my kids,” “I don’t want to have panic attacks anymore,” or “I don’t want to get depressed again.” In ACT these are called “dead person’s goals” (Lindsley, 1966).
  Dead person’s goals are things a corpse is better at than a living person. A corpse doesn’t take medication, doesn’t yell at kids, doesn’t have panic attacks, and doesn’t get depressed.
  In ACT, goals are refocused into “living goals” that a living person can do better. To convert dead person’s goals into living goals, you can ask questions like:
  “Let’s assume that were possible. If so, how would you act differently? What would you start or do more of? How would you behave differently toward friends or family?”
  “If you weren’t using medication, what would you be doing instead?”
  “If you weren’t yelling at your kids, how would you communicate with them?”
  “If you never had panic or depression, how would you behave differently in your life?”

-- The Bus Driver
  You are the driver of the bus called *your life*.
  The bus needs to head toward its destination, but there are many passengers on board.
  These passengers are memories you don’t like, fear, self-blame, worries, anxiety, shame, and so on.
  They try to grab the wheel, block the direction you want to go, and sometimes threaten or criticize you.
  One might say, “You’re going to fail. There’s no point in going.”
  Another whispers, “You’ll get hurt again. That road is dangerous.”
  Overwhelmed by these loud, threatening passengers, the driver eventually stops the bus to listen to them. The bus goes nowhere, and you lose your sense of direction.
  The key point: no matter how much they yell or threaten, the steering wheel is still in *your* hands. They can threaten you, but they cannot actually drive.
  What you can do is keep driving toward where you want to go with those noisy passengers aboard—without trying to throw them off the bus. Sometimes they’ll get louder, but you can leave the noise behind you and keep heading toward your life’s destination.

-- Two Mountains Metaphor
  Therapist: As you know, many people think therapists are enlightened beings who have solved all their problems. Even for me, it can seem like you’re climbing to the summit while I’m already up there. From the summit, I can see things you can’t yet see from below—the avalanche zones, the shortcuts you could take, or whether you’re clipping your crampons properly.
  But I don’t want you to think I’m already sitting comfortably at the top. The truth is, I’m climbing my own mountain too. I make mistakes and learn from them. Fundamentally, we’re the same.
  We’ll be climbing our mountains until the day we die. Over time, we climb better and appreciate the journey more. That’s what we’re doing here.

### When the Client Doesn’t Engage with Training

-- Dialogue Example ① – When a mindfulness exercise is declined
  Therapist: “It seems you’re a bit hesitant about the exercise I just suggested. What’s giving you pause?”
  Client: “It just… feels weird and awkward. I can’t focus.”
  Therapist: “That’s a natural reaction. Our brains are used to familiar modes—thinking and analyzing.
  But the feeling of ‘this is weird and awkward’ is useful information too.
  With that feeling present—or with the thought ‘this is weird’ just sitting next to you—
  how about we try something tiny? Just 20 seconds. And simply observe that feeling.”

-- Dialogue Example ② – When values exploration is declined
  Therapist: “We were about to explore what matters in your life right now, but it seems you’re hesitating.”
  Client: “What’s the point of defining that? Nothing changes. It all feels hollow.”
  Therapist: “It can feel that way. Is there an experience or emotion that’s fueling that thought right now?
  Something like a time when ‘things didn’t work out the way you wanted’?”
  Client: “…That’s always how it goes. Whenever I try, I end up disappointed.”
  Therapist: “That must have been really hard. For someone who’s had those experiences, it’s very natural to think, ‘What’s the point of this?’
  But this conversation here might be a chance to walk a slightly different path.
  We don’t have to decide anything right away. For now, maybe just recall one thing that has mattered in your life.”

-- Dialogue Example ③ – When exposure (behavioral experiments) is declined
  Client: “I feel like I’ll puke just imagining that situation. I just don’t want to do it.”
  Therapist: “That’s how hard it is—your body is shouting, ‘Danger, don’t do it!’
  That reaction is a protective response.
  Rather than fighting the feeling, could we do something *very* small while acknowledging it?
  For example, ‘taking one breath while thinking about that situation.’”
  Client: “…Maybe that’s okay.”
  Therapist: “Great. The point isn’t to eliminate fear; it’s to practice taking it along as a ‘companion.’”

### Differences Between Lower-Functioning and Higher-Functioning Clients

-- Example for a lower-functioning client
  Client: “Present tomorrow? I can’t. I’m too nervous—I’m not doing it.”
  Therapist: “I bet you feel really nervous. Do you notice your heart pounding or sweating?”
  Client: “Yes. I can barely breathe.”
  Therapist: “Those sensations show your brain is trying to protect you. We can’t avoid those scary feelings. Instead, what’s one tiny action you could do *while carrying* that feeling?”
  Client: “Uh… maybe just opening the slides?”
  Therapist: “Perfect. We’ll leave the scary feelings here, and we’ll just take one small step.”

-- Dialogue example for a higher-functioning client
  Client: “Just thinking about presenting makes me so anxious that all I want to do is skip.”
  Therapist: “That urge to avoid anxiety might actually be evidence that something important is ahead. What value is in this situation?”
  Client: “Taking responsibility for my work, and wanting to grow.”
  Therapist: “Great. Then one question: will we move in the direction of avoiding anxiety, or will we take anxiety along as a ‘companion’ and walk toward our values?”
  Client: “It’s scary, but the values path sounds right.”
  Therapist: “What’s the smallest values-based action you can do while carrying anxiety? Let’s plan it together.”

### When the Client Is Doubtful

-- Dialogue Example 1: Validating and normalizing emotion
  Client: “I’m not sure you truly want to help me. It’s hard to trust.”
  Therapist: “Yes, that feeling can come up—especially if you’ve been hurt before. It’s natural to doubt whether I’m sincere or whether this relationship is safe. Telling me when you feel that takes real courage.”

-- Dialogue Example 2: Values-centered conversation
  Client: “I don’t see the point of therapy. I don’t know, and I don’t trust you either.”
  Therapist: “Coming here wasn’t easy. Do you remember why you started therapy?”
  Client: “To handle my emotions better.”
  Therapist: “Is that value still important now?”
  Client: “It is.”
  Therapist: “Then, in line with that value, what could we do together? Even with doubt present, what’s one step we could take?”

### Ambiguous Responses

* Rather than jumping to conclusions, proceed slowly and simply until the intent is clear.

### Questions You Can Ask

-- Symptom statement
  You can add, “What do you want to gain from receiving treatment?” Answers to this say a lot about the client’s emotion-regulation difficulties.
  Most clients will say they want to *feel* a certain way (happiness, more confidence, lower self-esteem, etc.) or to *get rid of* certain emotions (anxiety, depression, bad memories, etc.).
  The question in **1b** is very useful: *How is this problem interfering with the client’s life? What is it blocking the client from doing (doing) and being (being)?*
  Clients’ answers usually fall into three groups:

  - “I can’t stand this feeling.” This points to **experiential avoidance**. You can follow up by asking which thoughts/feelings/memories are most painful, unwanted, or impactful.
  - “I don’t know who I am.” This points to **fusion with the conceptualized self**. Clients may be entangled with ideas like “I’m abnormal,” “I’m weird,” “I’m … [unclear].” You can ask, “What meaning is your mind giving those words?”
  - “It stops me from being/doing X, Y, Z.” This points to **values and goals**. You can then ask for more detail about X, Y, and Z.

-- Psychological flexibility and client strengths.
  Assess the areas of life in which the client already shows psychological flexibility—through **cognitive defusion**, **acceptance**, **self-as-context (the observing self)**, **contact with the present moment**, **connection with values**, and **committed action**. 
  This is a very important part of the intake. If we scored psychological flexibility from 0 to 100, almost no one would get 0. So look for which processes the client has used, in what contexts, and with what outcomes. You can ask directly:

  - Have you ever noticed you could *not* take your thoughts so seriously or get less entangled with them? Have there been times when your mind criticized you and you didn’t pay much attention?
  - Have you ever been able to tolerate uncomfortable feelings?
  - Have you ever felt you could step back from painful thoughts and memories rather than fighting them?
  - Do you practice any contemplative or spiritual disciplines?
    (This can include yoga, tai chi, martial arts, meditation, prayer, etc.)
  - When do you feel connected to your life, yourself, or the world? When do you feel meaning, purpose, vitality? During what activities? Where? When? With whom? When do you feel you’re making the most of your life, contributing to what matters, or connecting with something beyond yourself?
  - When do you do what needs to be done regardless of mood?
  - When are you fully awake to the present—i.e., not stuck in your head, but consciously aware and absorbed in what you’re doing? During which activities? With whom? Where? When?
